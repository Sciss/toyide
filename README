ToyIDE README

ToyIDE is an imitation of a full-featured IDE plus a toy language with
an interpreter and a compiler.

All the parts were built from scratch in Scala, without relying on any
existing code or libraries.

The project is purely educational. It is a product of a long vacation in
the country and a desire to learn how all this stuff really works.

Although I employed an evolutionary design in the development (to uncover
the reasons behind architecture), it turns out that many techniques in
the code come close to commonly used patterns.

I learned a lot from the project and hope it might be useful to the people
who want to know more about lexers, parsers, AST, Java bytecode and other
similar fun, but tricky things.
