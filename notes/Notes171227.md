# Lexer vs Parser

The Scala presentation compiler, as far as I can see, does not have a clear boundary between the two,
so the question is whether we need the Lexer in ToyIDE, or we always go through both stages.

For example in `AviserTestBase`, we have this pattern:

    val root = parser.parse(lexer.analyze(s))
    
So I suspect that this is often the case. Other uses:

- `DataImpl` - runs both separately, one after the other, no big issue,
  we just need to be able to populate `tokens` at some point.
- `EditorImpl` - passed to `PainterFactory.createPainters`
- `ImmediateTextPainter` - __could we spare that ?__
- `TextPainter` - __could we spare that ?__
- `VariantCellRenderer` - seems to be used only in a special popup dialog

Basically all come via `EditorFactory.createEditorFor`, so we might change that for Scala.
The `TextPainer` is the main painter, whereas `ImmediateTextPainter` seems to be unnecessary
for the most of it. Also, `paintLine` is basically an optimisation, and that's the only place
the lexer is used. Syntax highlight comes from `data.tokens`.
